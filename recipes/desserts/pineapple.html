<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup of packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 can of pineapple slices (20 oz), drained</li>
    <li>maraschino cherries (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Cake Batter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 cups of flour</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp of baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup of granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of pineapple juice (reserved from the canned pineapple slices)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;f</li>
    <li>In a 9-inch round cake pan, melt the butter and spread it evenly across the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the melted butter, covering the 
        entire bottom.</li>
    <li>Arrange the pineapple slices on top of the brown sugar, placing a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple slice if desired.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
    <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
        Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the pineapple juice and milk.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the pineapple juice and milk mixture. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing 
        until just combined after each addition. Do not overmix.</li>
    <li>Carefully pour the cake batter over the arranged pineapple slices and spread it evenly to cover the entire pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place a serving plate over the top of the pan, then carefully invert the cake onto the plate. Gently lift the pan to reveal the pineapple topping.</li>
    <li>Allow the cake to cool completely before serving. Slice and serve as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>
